FEATURE HISTORY 
 A Reverse chronology of features added to BME over the ages.
 Most likely completely wrong, but who cares, eh? 

Anyway, if there's anything drastically out here that you can't bear not to
be corrected, drop me a line. I'll see what I can do.

 V0.11.5 - 28th May, 2000
-------------------------

This is most likely the last BME for a long time. The main reason for this
is that I'm starting to come up (again) against barriers I created for myself 
by doing something one particular way a while back. As it is, BME is a perfectly
useable program, but also the process of adding some of the new features people
are asking for would mean re-writing much of the base stuff anyway, and I did
it so long ago that it would be easier to start from scratch. Plus, people are
starting to ask for the source... and whilst I don't mind in principle giving 
away my sourcecode, I'm not giving away some if this stuff just 'cause it's so
embarrassing...

Anyway, added this version was:

* Rudimentary JPEG support

* Went through and realigned the readmes to 80 characters instead of the 96
	I for some reason used last time I did this... :-)


 V0.11 - ? March, 2000
----------------------

 OK, this is where I sat down over the *Easter* holidays, and actually *did*
some coherent work on BME... ;-)

* Text shadow colour control and toggle. You can now change the colour of the 
shadow and determine if you want it painted at all.

 V0.10 - 17th December, 1999
----------------------------
 Ok, this is where I sat down during the Christmas Holidays and actually *did* 
some coherent work on BME... ;-) 

* Printing. At Last. And it Actually Works!!! <sounds of nervous breakdown>
* Workspace resizing. At Last. And it Actually Works!!! <maniacal giggling from 
	Programmer's chair>
* Went through the History and Readme files and actually put line breaks in so I 
	can read it on the UNIX boxes at Uni...

*** WARNING ***
I *do* know there are some (minor) things that I promised to put in this next 
release, and I also know I haven't done them. Um, sorry. They will get done, but 
I was too engrossed in Printing to worry about them just yet. 
Also, I am perfectly aware that currently, if you try and print a map bigger 
than one sheet of paper, it doesn't use any more sheets, so you only get the top 
left corner of your map. This will be fixed, but right now, I can't be bothered. 
Wait 'till the next release.
	<NOTE - still not fixed - printer support is stil lfairly buggy :( >

 V0.9.4 - 20th September, 1999
------------------------------
 Did this exist? I'm not sure. Delphi's Version Tracker tells me it did. I can't 
remember. If anyone can tell me what features went into this version, if I ever 
got around to releasing it, please do.

* This could have been the minor version from whence the ground could be 
raised/lowered between the ranges of 50 and -50. If *that*'s not enough for 
anybody, well...

 V0.9.3 - 13th September, 1999
------------------------------
 Essentially a big bug-fixing operation. Bugs fixed this version:

* The memory leak when the map was redrawn - this hadn't actually been *fixed* 
as such last time, I discovered - only delayed. This time it should be gone for 
good.
* The problem with Hex Numbering/Exporting big maps - fixed at the same time as 
the above.
* The bug whereby if a map larger than A4 were loaded, you would only be able to 
display the top left corner of it unless you had previously had open a map of 
that same size.

 V0.9.2 - Approx. 5th August, 1999
--------------------------------- 
 About half a day after I uploaded V0.9.1, I was notified that choosing 
'Tileset' from the Map menu didn't do anything but lose your map... V0.9.2 is a 
fix for that.

 V0.9.1 - 24th May, 1999 
------------------------
 This is a bug-fix release from V0.9, mainly dealing with the memory allocation 
problems that so many people noticed with the tileset handling and the memory 
leak on the map refresh... 
Also, Command Line parameters have been added, allowing you to choose a tileset, 
specify a tileset or specify a map file to load!

 V0.9 - 13th May, 1999 
----------------------
Water level, etc.... Oh, and Custom Tilesets. Completely Customisable tilesets.
And a cool new toolbar. (A Coolbar, none the less... ;-)

 V0.8 
-----
 OK. This gets a little fiddly. Essentially, this is a complete re-write of all 
the code. Except, of course, all the code isn't done yet, so there are a couple 
of things that were in previous versions that haven't appeared yet in this one. 
Next time, my friends, next time. 

 V0.66 / V0.7 
-------------
 A disaster! Released with serious bugs that I really didn't have time to fix. 
Because I was working on the re-write! It was essentially meant to be bug fixes 
from 0.65, but it introduced a couple of bad mistakes, and I simply gave up on 
the whole thing. If anybody is using this version, quickly download a different 
one - I'm about as happy with 0.66/0.7 as I am with 0.1! 

 V0.65 - Sometime around September, 98 
--------------------------------------
 This was, up until very recently, the version of choice. I took out Hex 
Painting, since it didn't do much I could see was useful but slowed down the 
program one hell of a lot, added a couple of minor things - I think a couple 
more options.  

 V0.6 - 29th July, 98 
---------------------
 Finally, BME can print!! 	
	<Note - this has since been taken out.. sorry>
	<Note - this has since been put back in... <grin>>

(Use 150 dpi or less, and choose appropriate graphics dithering options!)
Almost more importantly, you can now select the tileset you want to use from 
inside BME, so you don't have to rename or copy files or directories any more 
(If any of you were actually using custom tilesets in the first place - see 
downloads section)
Lots more options are available from inside BME, allowing you to toggle many 
features to your liking.
There's a floating Hex Highlighter to show you exactly which hex you are about 
to change.
	<Note - this *has* since been taken out. It was silly.>
Finally you can now paint hexes in a continuous mouse-stroke instead of 
repeatedly clicking.
	<And this has too. As Devillin said... 'Mouse Painting is EVIL!!!'>

 V0.5 - 4th July, 98 
--------------------
Hex Numbering is Here! 
Also, ground can be raised/lowered between -9 and 9, instead of -4 and 4! 
What's more, I've re-jigged the menus!
Even Better than that, you can now specify exactly where roads and rivers leave 
your map!
	<Note - this never got rewritten properly. It's due in the
	 *next* rewrite. :-) >
Finally, there are some options you can change, although I haven't put in INI 
file support yet!  
	<Note - ...and never will. Seeing as BMe is now a 32-bit only app 
	 *anyway*, I'll be using the registry.>

 V0.4 - 1st May, 98 
-------------------
 Aesthetically, the ugly buttons down the side have all been replaced by nice 
icons, and all have ToolTips. I haven't bothered placing the icons in much of an 
order so far - it isn't finished, so why waste my time making it look nice when 
I could be adding functionality? 
Buildings and Concrete are in, but the Building Sprites aren't great - just two 
minute jobs, unfortunately. Concrete also hasn't been finished, I intend to add 
edges similar to the ones on the Citytech maps.

A couple of bugs have been eliminated, including the one where when you load a 
large map it doesn't let you move to the whole map, just the top left section.

There's a new menu, Maps, where export and nuke have been moved to. I've finally 
got rid of that 'Refresh all' button - I only ever needed it in the VB version, 
and that got wiped ages ago! This is also where stuff like the options window 
will be accessed from when it's been implemented. (Start telling me what things 
you'd like to have as options!) 

 V0.3 - 4th April, 98 
---------------------
 Added roads and rivers, and fixed several bugs, most notably the one where an 
export only caught the top left section of the map. 

 V0.2 - 28th March, 98 
----------------------
 First version written in Delphi - Nothing major new but much, much faster! 

 V0.1 - A long time ago 
-----------------------
 Original beta release, written in Visual Basic. Slow, useless and I don't think it even had export. I can't remember, and I've deleted it now.

If this is the only version you have, download a new one! It now takes up less 
space, you don't need a runtime library and there are lots more features. First, 
however, send me a copy. I want to find one so I can put it up on the BME 
homepage and point people to it when they complain about lack of 
functionality...
